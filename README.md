                ),
              ),
              Bubble(
                text: "Foodüçî",
                activeColor: Colors.red,

                textStyle: const TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 16,
                ),
              ),
            ],
            selectedBubbles: selectedBubbles,
            size: const Size(
              900,
              300,
            ),
            onSelect: (bubble) {
              //  logic on bubble selection
            },
            onRemoved: (bubble) {
              //  logic when bubble is un-selected
            },
          )
```

* Improve positioning of bubbles initially to avoid any possible overlapping between bubbles
* Additional constraints to avoid bubbles whose sizes might be larger than the size of the bubbles selection box
